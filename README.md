# Project Motivation
This is a project for my Data Scientist NanoDegree at Udacity. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). In this article, we'll combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type.

There are 3 datasets. These data sets contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app.

* Portfolio: information about the offers
* Profile: information about the clientes
* Transcript: information about the events 

Therefore, we'll try to answer the following questions based on this datasets:

1. Is there a correlation between income and amount of completed offers? 
2. What is the proportion of clients who have completed offers based on their age? 
3. Do older customers complete more offer than recent customers?
